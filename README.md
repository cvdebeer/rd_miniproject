# r_d_miniproject

Working along this project.
we learnt cloud9 short cuts to create elements, classes and nesting
We worked through the process of styling the page, adding and removing classes at a later stage in order to fit them into one element for styling.
Also, special attention to adding css rules in a decending fashion from the outer elements to the inner so as to keep the styling correct.
